<h1>Soy Pretraining</h1>
The main point is getting this line of code to work with a soy dataset

<pre>
python -m train wandb=null experiment=hg38/hg38_hyena model.d_model=128 model.n_layer=2 dataset.batch_size=256 train.global_batch_size=256 dataset.max_length=1024 optimizer.lr=6e-4 trainer.devices=1
</pre>
<a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna?tab=readme-ov-file#pretraining-on-human-reference-genome">source</a>

<ol>
<li>
Start off by replicating the hg38/hg38_hyena experiment file 
</li>
<li>
hg38_hyena references the hg38.yaml pipeline file. make a soy pipeline file. pipeline file refernces the dataset to be used, metrics, and other. change dataset to soy
</li>
<li>
the pretraining task will require putting soy sequences in the **data** folder. but, really the emphasis is on getting the dataloader to work, as clarified here <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna?tab=readme-ov-file#pretraining-on-your-own-data">https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna?tab=readme-ov-file#pretraining-on-your-own-data</a> they recommend inspecting the species_dataset.py dataloader 
</li>
<li>
so go into src/dataloaders. the species dataloader is defined in datasets module <code>genomics.py</code> defines a class based on that dataset. the dataset and dataloader constructs are from pytorch <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html">https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html</a>
    
   <blockquote> `Dataset` stores the samples and their corresponding labels, and `DataLoader` wraps an iterable around
    the `Dataset` to enable easy access to the samples.
    </blockquote> 
    
    The dataset is defined in <code>datasets/soy_dataset.py</code> The associated dataloader is defined in <code>genomics.py</code> (that is where all the other dataloaders are). NOTE: The authors seem to be using the task lm and task next_token_pred to mean the same thing: (predictive) language modeling = predicting the next token. I’m unsure why both terms are used. however, I don’t want to update the experiment config just yet because I sense that the task is being used elsewhere (e.g. task/lm.yaml and trainer/lm.yaml).
</li>
    
<li>
configs/datasets/soy.yaml needs to be updated to have a species, species_dir, and total_size that are required by the dataloader. I am not sure what total_size is at this moment, but we will use the same value as species.yaml
