<h1>Notes on Pretraining Soy</h1>

<ol>

<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>

<li>
Change the extension from nt to fa
</li>

<li>
Move fa into wdr/data/soy
</li>


<h2>Set up configs</h2>
<h3>experiment folder</h3>
<li>Make the experiment file inside /wdr/configs/experiment/soy. This was
	copied from hg38_hyena.yaml Change pipeline to "soy" in line 3.</li>
<h3>dataset folder</h3>

<li>Make a SoyDataset class in soy_dataset.py file in src/dataloaders/datasets folder. This was based on the species_classification.py file provided.
Modify the wdr/src/dataloaders/datasets/species_dataset.py file per the <a
		href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna?tab=readme-ov-file#pretraining-on-your-own-data">pretraining
		instructions</a>.

	In the file split the data into training, testing, and validation sets.
	The split is done chromosome-wise. So 11 chromosomes were set aside for
training, 4 were set aside for validation, and 5 were set aside for testing.
Use a single species (soy) instead of multiple. Change the task to
"next_token_pred" only. </li>

<li>Create the dataset config file for soy in /wdr/configs/dataset. This is
	based off of /wdr/configs/dataset/hg38.yaml. Add reference to soy fa
	file and bed file. </li>

<h3>pipeline folder</h3>

<li>Copy /wdr/configs/pipeline/hg38.yaml into soy.yaml Change dataset to soy. </li>

<h3>evals folder</h3>

<li>Copy /home/dsalinas/wdr/configs/hg38.yaml into soy.yaml. No modifications made. Tokenizer could be changed. </li>


<li>In src/dataloaders/genomics.py, add reference to the SoyDataset class
	created in src/datloaders/datasets/soy_dataset.py in the imports. Then
	make a class Soy based on the Secies class in the same file. Update
task to be "next_token_pred". update _name_ to soy.</li>

<p> need insight on total_size in soy.yaml should prob do a clean redo honestly.</p>
