<h1>Prelude</h1>

<p>I am currently Data Science faculty at <a href="https://msmary.edu/">Mount
St.  Mary's University</a> in Maryland.</p>

<p>I graduated from Montana State University in 2018, and was <a
href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/tda/people.html">part</a> of the Computational
Geometry and Topology group.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><i>Ideas, definitions, and figures are taken from E&amp;H Ch. 3</i></p>

<p> We care about simplicial complexes because they allow us to describe a
complicated space in terms of simple components. Simple components allow for
easier compute. A simplex is a very simple component. </p>

<h2>Simplex</h2>

My intuition: a \(k\)-simplex is flat, convex, and resembles the boundary of
\(k+1\)-dimensional polyhedron. It is a minimal object.

<h3>Definition: Simplex</h3>

<p>A \(k\)-simplex is the convex hull of \(k\) + 1 affinely independent
points.</p> <img src="fig1.png" width="100%">

<h3>Definition: Convexity and Affine Independence </h3>

<p>Let \(u_0, ..., u_k\) be affinely independent points. A point \[ x = \sum_i
\lambda_i u_i \] is a convex combination if all \(\lambda_i\) sum to 1 and are
greater than 0.</p>

<p>A set of points is affinely independent points if the member \(u_i\) cannot
be generated as an affine combination of the  rest of the members \(u_j,\:j \neq
i \). The book gives this definition as an equivalence requirement:</p>

\[ \sum_i \lambda_i u_i = \sum_i \mu_i u_i \iff \forall i, \: \lambda_i = \mu_i \]
