<h1>Prelude</h1>

<p>I am currently Data Science faculty at <a href="https://msmary.edu/">Mount
St.  Mary's University</a> in Maryland.</p>

<p>I graduated from Montana State University in 2018, and was <a
href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/tda/people.html">part</a> of the Computational
Geometry and Topology group.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><i>Ideas, definitions, and figures are all taken from
	<a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-69">E&amp;H</a> Ch. 3</i></p>

<p> We care about simplicial complexes because they allow us to describe a
complicated space in terms of simple components. Simple components allow for
easier compute. A simplex is a very simple component. </p>

<h2>Simplex</h2>

My intuition: a \(k\)-simplex is flat, convex, and resembles the boundary of
\(k+1\)-dimensional polyhedron. It is a minimal object.

<h3>Definition: Simplex</h3>

<p>A \(k\)-simplex is the convex hull of \(k\) + 1 affinely independent
points.</p> <img src="fig1.png" width="600px">

<h3>Definition: Convexity and Affine Independence </h3>

<p>Let \(U\) be a set \(u_0, ..., u_k\) affinely independent points. A point \[
x = \sum_i \lambda_i u_i \] is a convex combination if all \(\lambda_i\) sum to
1 and are greater than 0. The set of convex combinations is the convex
hull.</p>

<p>A set of points is affinely independent points if the member \(u_i\) cannot
be generated as an affine combination of the  rest of the members \(u_j,\:j
\neq i \). The book gives this definition as an equivalence requirement: \[
\sum_i \lambda_i u_i = \sum_i \mu_i u_i \iff \forall i, \: \lambda_i = \mu_i
\]</p>


<h3>Recursivity of Simplices</h3>

<p>Any subset of \(U\) will also be affinely independent. A simplex is composed of smaller simplices.</p>

<h3>Definitions: Face and Boundary</h3>

<p>The convex hull of \(U - u_i\) is a face of the convex hull of \(U\).</p>

<p>The boundary of a simplex is the union of all its faces.</p>
