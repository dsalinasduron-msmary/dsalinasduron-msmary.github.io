<h1>Prelude</h1>

<p>I am currently Data Science faculty at <a href="https://msmary.edu/">Mount
St.  Mary's University</a> in Maryland.</p>

<p>I graduated from Montana State University in 2018 and was <a
href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/tda/people.html">part</a> of the Computational
Geometry and Topology group.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><i>Ideas, definitions, and figures are all taken from <a
		href="https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-69">E&amp;H</a> Ch. 3</i>
unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p> We care about simplicial complexes because they allow us to describe a
complicated space in terms of simple components. Simple components allow for
easier compute. A simplex is a very simple component. </p>

<h2>Simplex</h2>

My intuition: a \(k\)-simplex is flat, convex, and resembles the boundary of
\(k+1\)-dimensional polyhedron. It is a minimal object.

<h3>Definition: Simplex</h3>

<p>A \(k\)-simplex is the convex hull of \(k\) + 1 affinely independent
points.</p> <img src="fig1.png" width="600px">

<h3>Definition: Convexity and Affine Independence </h3>

<p>Let \(U\) be a set \(u_0, ..., u_k\) affinely independent points. A point \[
x = \sum_i \lambda_i u_i \] is a convex combination if all \(\lambda_i\) sum to
1 and are greater than 0. The set of convex combinations is the convex
hull.</p>

<p>A set of points is affinely independent points if the member \(u_i\) cannot
be generated as an affine combination of the  rest of the members \(u_j,\:j
\neq i \). E&amp;H gives this definition as an equivalence requirement: \[
\sum_i \lambda_i u_i = \sum_i \mu_i u_i \iff \forall i, \: \lambda_i = \mu_i
\]</p>


<h3>Recursivity of Simplices</h3>

<p>Any subset of \(U\) will also be affinely independent. A simplex is composed of smaller simplices.</p>

<h3>Definitions: Face and Boundary</h3>

<p>The convex hull of \(U - u_i\) is a face of the convex hull of \(U\).</p>

<img src="fig1.png" width="600px">

<p>The boundary of a simplex is the union of all its faces.</p>

<h2>Simplicial Complex</h2>

<p>My intuition: a simplicial complex is a bunch of simplices attached at their
faces. E&amp;H clarify that this produces a closure under taking faces and
prevents improper intersections.</p>

<h3>Definition: Simplicial Complex</h3>

<p>From E&amp;H p. 75<p>

<blockquote>A simplicial complex \(K\) is a finite collection of simplices such
	that \(\sigma \in K\) and \(\tau \leq \sigma\) implies \(\tau \in K\)
</blockquote>
<p>... this is the closure under taking faces ... </p>
<blockquote>
	and \(\sigma, \sigma_0 \in K\) implies \(\sigma \cap \sigma_0\) is either empty or a face of both
</blockquote>
<p> ... this forbids the improper intersections ... </p>

<h3>Abstract Simplicial Complex</h3>

<p>Although motivated by affine transformations in Euclidean space, simplicial
complexes can be studied productively as a finite collection of sets \(A\)
where all subsets of its members are included in \(A\). So, if \(\alpha\) is a
member of \(A\) and \(\beta\) is a subset of \(\alpha\), then \(\beta\) is also
in \(A\). This encodes the inclusion of faces. </p>

<h2>Theorems</h2>

<h3>Theorem: Geometric Realization Theorem</h3>

<p>Any abstract simplicial complex of dimension \(d\) has a realization in
\(\mathbb{R}^{2d+1}\)</p>

<h3>Simplicial Approximation Theorem</h3>

<p>From E&amp;H p. 79</p>

<blockquote>If \(g: |K| \rightarrow |L|\) is continous, then there is a
	sufficiently large integer \(n\) such that \(g\) has a simplicial
	approximation \(f:Sd^nK \rightarrow L\)</blockquote>

<p>Intuition: if there is a continous map between the elements in \(|K|\) and \(|L|\), we can subdivide \(K\) into small enough simplices to map simplices in \(L\). </p>

<p>Discussion question: What is an easy way to define a mapping between two simplicial complexes?</p>
